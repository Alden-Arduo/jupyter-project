    " \n",
    "The second data source is from Wikepedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_New_Zealand where we got our  table called ‘The top countries for international visitor arrivals to New Zealand’.\n",

    "\n",
    "We used Stats NZ API as they are New Zealand’s national statistics office. We are sure that the datasets we got from here are credible and valid.\n",
    "For example, the ‘Filled jobs by regional council’ dataset is actually from Inland Revenue.\n",

    "In addition, both data sources also have a ‘lock’ symbol at the top left beside the link which indicates that it is not available for public edit. They are also updated regularly e.g second datasource is updated on September 6, 2021 and the third datasource is updated on October 10, 2021.\n",

    "### C.What target do we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first two datasets from STATS NZ, our target for the ‘Filled jobs by regional council’ dataset is to create a model of the ‘Total number of Filled Jobs (2019-2020)’ and the intended use of the data is to show that the total number of filled jobs was affected during Covid in 2019-2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target for the ‘Overseas cargo exports and imports by New Zealand port’ dataset is to calculate net export from this dataset to create a model for the ‘Net export (2019-2020)’. The intended use of this to show that net export was affected during Covid 2019-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two datasets come from Wikipedia. The target for the ‘The top countries for international visitor arrivals to New Zealand’ dataset is to create a model for ‘Annual Number of Overseas Tourists (2016-2020)’. The intended use for this is to see the trend up until 2019 and compare that trend upto 2020 to see if Covid affected the annual number of tourists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target for the ‘Gross domestic product trend of New Zealand, at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund’ is to create a model for the ‘GDP of New Zealand (2016-2020)’. The use for this is to determine if Covid affected the GDP in 2020 and to see how it compares to 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate purpose of this is to combine all dataset into one relational dataset.\n",
    "This part would answer our main question  “which factor affected the NZ GDP during Covid?”\n"

    "\n",

    "For the API, we had to make an account to get the subscription key then use that to access the open data catalogue. Then we had to specify the Catalogue name and the Resource ID for the dataset we wanted.\n",

    "The techniques we used to fix the first dataset are filter(), is.na(), group_by(), summarise() and sum().\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second dataset, because we wanted the net export, we had to create two new data frames called import and export. Then we had to combine them into one data frame via left_join() so we could apply export-import for every row. Followed by applying filter(), is.na(), group_by(),  summarise(), sum(), mutate(), ymd() and select().\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix the problem for the third dataset, we had to use a different css selector and then index to that table to get the desired table. In addition, the data frame is in a wide format so we had to turn it into a long format for easy wrangling. Techniques we have applied are na.omit(), group_by(), rename(), filter(), select() and as.numeric() .\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth dataset has many null values however these null values are in the columns we don’t want. So, we simply select() then filter(). We also applied rename() and as.numeric().\n",
    "\n",
    "For the relational dataset, we had to rename the column ‘year’ into ‘Year’ and keep the class in <dbl>. We had to use mutate(), ymd(), filter(), group_by(), summarise() and mean(). Then we left_join every dataframe by column/key ‘Year’. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we produced a plot for every data frame using ggplot().\n"

    "### F. managed to achieve and what we failed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We managed to prove that total filled jobs, net export, tourist number and GDP were all affected by Covid. In return, we also managed to answer our main question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project is to get all the datasets online via API, web-scraping or using a link address that automatically downloads the dataset when passed in read_csv(). We managed to do the first two, but the last one was where we were not successful. We found a dataset about the number of tourists annually, but that dataset is missing the year 2019 and 2020 which is our focus. However,  we managed to find the right dataset for tourist numbers with the year 2019 and 2020. As a result, we have used API and web scraping for our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we were aware that there are also domestic tourists, but we didn’t include them as it is very hard to find the dataset for them. We would have to get a dataset for every region then join them. Additionally, domestic tourists can travel by car, train or bus and that’s usually not recorded. For example, I can go to Queenstown by car without being recorded and I’m still considered a tourist. Therefore, we settled with using the number of overseas tourists as their number is recorded, the dataset was available and we thought they were significantly affected as they cannot travel to NZ due to closed borders.\n"

    "If there is more time, the next step for this project is to actually look at the individual region as every region responds differently to different factors. For example, the effect of the loss of tourists would be completely different in Otago (due to Queenstown city) region than in the West Coast.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it would be interesting to know what other factors affected the economy during Covid. It would be interesting to do some predictions as well e.g. if GDP would continue to decrease in the year 2021. \n"
